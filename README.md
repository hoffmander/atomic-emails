### Install MJML

Follow the instructions to install MJML, you can find it their documentation or on their [MJML Git Repo](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml). MJML Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and I highly recommend using their syntax libraries for [Sublime](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml-syntax) and [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-mjml).
